The issue is that these are too big for a regular case. Unscrew it for presentation and the pen body is too thick to close the lid on most double pen cases. Dropping it into a pen pot hides the best part. It *really* needs some sort of custom display. Like, say, a pool cue rack. So I made one. \n\nAlthough the stand-alone rack I made first looked OK, it was a bit top heavy and not up to the standard I had envisioned. Then I thought \"what if I include a rack of billiard balls?\" So I whipped up a base, 3D printed a rack, and purchased a set of 1\" billiard balls. now THAT looks better!\n\nBy the time it was finished, the bill of materials included two 3-pen starter kits, and three laser inlay kits.

Its style combines well with wood or acrylics and depending on the blank chosen, the set will appeal almost everyone. The 8 millimeter size accommodates a universal fit for any hand.\nThe only drawback is when the ink refill needs to be replaced. The end user of the pen should be furnished with detailed instructions on the reuse of the REFILL EXTENDER.\nIn addition, the suggested refill replacement is a Parker Quink Flow. The refill extender will not properly seat on the Parker refill. The hole in the top of the Parker refill is not deep enough. This causes the pen point to protrude out from the end of the tip.\nShortening the small part of the refill extender which fits into the small hole of the refill will remedy this issue.

The videos did help but it wasn't until I freelanced a bit that it all came together. \n\n1. I shortened the body just a bit. This offers a little bit more wiggle room between the ends and allows the body to spin without friction.\n\n2. I turned both ends of the body to the same diameter. This is necessary for the next step.\n\n3. I added a second nut at the bottom of each bolt (see pictures). This makes it easy to adjust the distance between the top and bottom gears. (Leaving a tiny gap allows the body to spin freely. I also think the extra hardware adds to the steampunk look.)\n\nIf you asked me during the build, this would have gotten no more than 3 stars.

The end cap is also shorter and hollow.  I made over 50 of the previous ice cream scoops and I don't see a reason for these changes. Also, you made a change in the turning of the wood.  You had the simple procedure with the previous scoop and made the new one irksome You must flip the bushings and added a tenon.  And you suggested the wood to be a 1/16 of an inch short of four inches. I don't understand that at all.  All the ice cream scoops I made were 4-1/2 to 5 inches.  I had no problem at using the previous bushings to make the new scoops. I drilled the 7/16\" hole in the wood.  Then did the turning and sanding. I then drilled the 15/32\" holes just deep enough for the scoop and end cap. I used the no-stick plastic bushings PKDRYBU to apply the CA glue for finishing.

It runs fine and it got me interested in turning. But turning anything small and delicate like a pen was like going squirrel hunting with a bazooka. Yeah, it worked and I made several pens, cups, segmented bowls, mistakes and a lot of opps moments. I learned a lot with it. I made enough doughnut money off these things to buy the Turncrafter 12inch. I researched several and each had some items I liked. Turncrafter Commander 12\" had more I liked plus the price and reviews was the deciding factor. \nThe difference is night and day! No noise, no rattles, Super smooth and quite, E-Z to adjust the speed, No back ache from bending over anymore, (i'm 6'6\"). Mounted it on a home grown cabinet with dust port built in made just for the Turncrafter. I love this thing. I actually enjoy turning things now, where before I had an almost love/hate relationship with the ShopSmith. I now leave the Shop Smith setup as a drill press to drill out pen blanks. \nTurnCraffter arrived on time, In two boxes. Easy to assemble, I mounted my own tool rack onto the home grown cabinet and the one that came with the Turncrafter mounted on the wall close by and holds extra tools I use on the lathe. I have had it for about 3 months now turned SEVERAL items and I LOVE it,  Tool rest is super easy to adjust on the fly.

So I cut new ones to length.  I wanted to experiment with these pen kits, I wanted to try something simple, effective, easy, cheap.  So I bought rubber tubing (6mm I.D. / 8mm O.D.) in various colors.\n\nI started off with Navy Blue and Pink tubing, soon to try Purple, Transparent Red, Orange Red, Red, Bright Orange, Neon Green, Yellow, Sky Blue.  It cost me about $2.21 per meter of tubing for each color.\n\nTo install the tubing, I cut a segment about 1/2\" longer than the brass tubes.  I pulled the tubing down the brass tubes carefully so as not to flatten the tubes.  During the top process, if I wasn't able to feed the tubing onto the brass, I used the second blank to hold the shape to make it easier to slide the tubing onto the blank.\n\nI DID NOT USE CA to adhere the tubing to the brass.  The dimensions are perfect for a snug fit.  Once the tubing was installed, I carefully trimmed off the excess and used the sharp flat side of the razor blade to square up the tubing to the brass.  The extra 1/2\" is in case if the material tears or you make a mistake while trimming the tubing or squaring the blank.  Start off with the side that has the least tubing and finish with the side with excess tubing.\n\nAssembly is simple and easy.  Feels grippy and comfortable to write with.  Beauty part is if you don't want to make a mess, don't want to use CA/sandpaper, don't have mini-lathe, tools or anything else, this method might be for you.  Particularly if you're looking for an economical finish to a Funline pen.\n\nYou can mix and match the tubing or cut the tubing off, disassemble, and start over with new tubing if you don't like the color or if the tubing has become scratched or worn too much.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"John","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/51c984988b8b2db7b73f93fd4cc49ffe_1672812591467_0.jpeg"},{"id":46859,"product":"Free Floating Lathe Extension Bed for 12in.

The stars are extremely small and fit in ONE WAY.  There is a light (whiter) side, and a darker (tan/brown) side of the stars.  If you look closely, you will see there is a SLIGHT taper from the dark side down to the light.  Ergo, the WHITE side goes in first - counter-intuitive as you want white stars!  If fitted this way, the stars go in well. Make sure to use the brass tube during setting off the stars to avoid crushing the blue barrel.  Remove the tube and saturate well with thin CA.   I SAND (quick touch on belt sander) my blanks after they?ve dried to remove all high spots (stars) to avoid catching them while turning.  After doing the stars, the stripes are a piece of cake!

I figured he would enjoy having a custom set as a Christmas gift. Shipments from PSI usually arrive in a couple days but, that's probably because they are based in Philadelphia, PA and I live about 2 hrs east of there. The kits are nice. The 2 kits of 3 darts each came in 2 bags in one larger bag. I used acrylic blanks for the 2 sets. Turning is standard. Assembly is really easy as well. The most difficult part is getting the \"lead wood\" inserted into the shaft. In order to get a consistent weight I took all the parts for one dart and placed them on a scale. Then I added the \"lead wood\" (this is a bird's nest of fine strands of meatal threads). Each kit was pretty consistent with a weight of 17 grams before I added the extra weight. Final weight of each dart ended up at 21 grams. Assembly was just like a pen. I used my pen press to press the brass ends into the tube, then threaded the tip and tail. The vanes come as on flat piece so you just need to unfold 2 vanes and slide them into the tail. I have not thrown these yet and I did not worry about balance. Once we start to throw them and see how they fly I can take them apart and adjust if needed, then add some glue to hold the weight in place. Without glue, the weight would just migrate forward on impact. I also made a little holder for them.","rating":5,"user":"TwistedTworks","firstName":"Mike","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/659af85c46e4da5b30412aed39efd047_1670245652434_0.jpeg"},{"id":45894,"product":"Devin Gun Metal Click Pen Kit","sku":"PKDVNGM","reviewTitle":"Great pen, people love them and easy to turn","reviewText":"Once you figure out that you have to make sure tube isn't shortened in finishing ends process, very easy to turn.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Robert","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/95e2fde89dc22390240f351a857750a1_1670180774981_0.jpeg"},{"id":45892,"product":"Antique Copper Housing Coffee Grinder Mechanism: 3 in. x 3 in. x 5 in. high","sku":"PKGRIND3","reviewTitle":"Hexagon Coffee Grinder","reviewText":"Grinder works easily and is adjustable as described in the details.

Choosing your blanks with this in mind may help avoid any unfortunate cracking/fracturing of the blank during turning.  Proper glueing with a good epoxy will also help ensure success.  My one negative regarding this particular kit is that I received one with a damaged \"lower cap\", such that when assembled, the cap could not slide over it.  An email has been sent and I hope to receive a replacement part, as it was not damaged from any assembly process.

This keyless chuck has made frequent drill bit changes very easy  on my hand and also improved efficiency. The threaded hole at the outboard end of the Morse taper allowed me to securely tighten the chuck in the short tailstock fitting of the Shopsmith (with appropriate bushing and washers) and prevent spinning if the drill bit happens to catch.

I love a rollerball pen and I had a resin blank I'd been holding onto for years. Assembly was so easy and the parts fit perfectly. Others have noted that the nib will loosen with use. This is a minor issue to me. The sound when preparing for use and putting away and the heft in the hand during use are tremendous. It takes a standard size cartridge so you have a lot of choices to customize the writing experience.\nI find that I write better with a heftier pen. Lighter pens tend to wander too easily. My only complaint is that I wish the clip was a little more aggressive. It does tend to slip around in my pocket. Like I said, I bought this for myself but I can see this as a real sharp seller. The preference for chrome was due to the blank I used.\nI wanted to make sure I didn't destroy the completed blank during assembly, so I watched things very closely. I'm not sure why the kit is designed to take the blank down so thin, maybe overall weight. In any case, I did notice some distortion of the blank when pressing the parts into place. As always, special care during assembly is advised. There is no visible distortion after assembly, so  this kit might lend itself to plastics rather than wood or clay.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Forrest","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/5f8d8392b5808c24c6059e9d16baf1fc_1641409943273_0.jpeg"},{"id":43078,"product":"Cat Gold Twist Pen Kit","sku":"PKCAT24","reviewTitle":"Cat lover","reviewText":"I am new to pen turning.

It does take me a little longer to square up blanks as opposed to the trim kit used in my electric drill.  But the more I get used to the sander the faster I will square blanks.  This sander has a dust collection port where my small shop vac is attached.  It doesn't do a great job but is somewhat helpful.   I am extremely pleased with the machine as I find it is accurate, quiet, has enough speed for the job and takes up very little space.  I rated it five stars and feel if you want an efficient and accurate alternative to squaring up pen blanks, this machine will do the job.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Doug","url":null},{"id":42732,"product":"Stabilized Colored Turquoise Box Elder 3/4 in. x 3/4 in. x 5 in.

With square box-making techniques, I find the build is time intensive and so it is hard to make those designs pay off to a suitable price point. I thought I would try the larger unit and using stock images from the Penn State Industries website, I offered it in my catalog at a fairly premium price. I got a couple of orders right away, but one of the clients asked about a round base instead of square. The more I thought about it, the more I liked that idea - especially since it is an easier build than a square box with four mitered or jointed sides, a base, a lid, and a drawer. Found a review and design here by Rick B. from 2020 and modified his design with a slightly smaller base (about 5.25\" in diameter).  Big interest in this design and I am now out of stock and will be re-ordering very soon. I am hearing good things about the durability of both the burr mill and the nylon gears so hopefully this will be as durable as it is attractive. One thing I would ask Penn State Industries to consider in future would be a template for drilling the bolt holes - would be really handy, lower risk of error, and save a lot of time.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Stephen","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/a5efe72188003cbf08dcec29c84476e1_1638848342068_0.jpeg"},{"id":42613,"product":"Fidget Rollerball Gun Metal Pen Kit","sku":"PKFIDGM","reviewTitle":"Clip Me","reviewText":"It's a very well made kit but could use a clip.\u00a0 The ball-bearings make for a long lasting, smooth fidgeting experience and the long blank really allows you to get creative with choosing your favorite blank to showcase your turning and blank selection.\u00a0 Only lacks a clip which would help make it less likely to roll when set on a desk or table.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Andrew","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/3f15b5e7107846ccbad6c8d5089720bd_1638833972694_0.jpeg"},{"id":42610,"product":"Insta-Change Jaw Chuck System","sku":"CSCBARR52","reviewTitle":"Quick change chuck","reviewText":"Great system easy to change when i need to","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Logan","url":null},{"id":42608,"product":"Disc Stylus 24kt Gold Pen Kit","sku":"PKDSTY24","reviewTitle":"Drawing and playing games.","reviewText":"Easy to turn and I like the weight of the finished product.

Back then I paid $259 for just the lathe - no extras but mine did not have the digital readout. I am on Penn States's site to look at buying a chuck. So I thought I would leave a VERY long-term users review.  I have had no problems at all! Using it was easy to set up.  Just plug in the cords and start turning.  Only about 16\" between centers without the bed extension. (I have one)  That makes it 39\" between centers.  I turned my first piece and was more than satisfied.  I built a Heavy stand from my old ShopNotes vol. 2 Issue no. 10.  It fits perfectly.  All in all, I got a great little lathe. The only thing I have done to it is to change the belt. I expect that with age.  I have enjoyed my lathe!

I made it a bit longer than the instructions suggested, 10.5\" long from top of brass to bottom of handle, which I thin gives it a bit more versatility.  I used a piece of curly (I don't know if you can see it from the photo) hickory from a friend who had a tree come down, and tapped it with a 1/2\" tap, set in epoxy.\n\nYou only have to be careful about a few things.  As others have pointed out, there's a bit of a burr on the drilled hole in the head, but that can easily be taken care of with a diamond or fine file or even sandpaper.  You want to make sure that the fit into the drilled hole is a very close fit, and I dismounted the handle from the lathe a number of times to make sure.  And make sure that the amount of threaded rod sticking out of the handle doesn't bottom out in the brass head.  Best thing to do is to have a short enough piece sticking out  that the brass head seats securely on the shoulder (end) of the handle.\n\nI wanted to try making an oval handle using offcenter turning, but I couldn't figure out how to thread the rod in and make sure that the long axis of the oval is in line with the brass head.  I may try NOT threading the hole and just epoxying it in.\n\nI posted a photo on my FB page and ALL my friends liked it.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Gregory","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/ba0c621ceb825cca0f326b9ca110aaad_1634527052529_0.jpeg"},{"id":42064,"product":"Big Ben Gold and Chrome Two Tone Cigar Pen Kit","sku":"PKBIGTTB","reviewTitle":"Solid and well balanced","reviewText":"First time tuning a Big Ben.

These pens and pencil kits really are fun to turn, they WORK, so I'm pretty happy so far.  They will be designed as pen/pencil gifts with accompanying wood gift boxes.\n\nReason?  I grew tired of the plastic mechanism of most click pens failing.  I DO NOT like paying money for a so-called quality pen kit (with the plastic click pen mechanism) only to have more than 30% of them fail.  I've been turning pens for years and this really twists me!  I've returned my last set of plastic click pen mechanism pens to PENN STATE - will not order them again in the future.  These EDC pens are sturdy, they work and for the most part are affordable.  Bear in mind, I make these for gifts, I will not accept a second rate pen kit AT ALL.   Even one of the support gents said he has been trying to get PENN ST get rid of these mechanisms - guess some people just don't listen.  Maybe they will NOW!\n\nI would recommend these EDC sets without reservation.  Take your chances with whatever plastic inserts as you will.  ME, I'm done with that garbage.

I was able to address all of the issues with no need for customer service. As always, the instructions seldom pertain to the actual machine in the box. A tad confusing at first but no deal breaker. The \"fit and finish\" was the most time consuming problem. There was some red paint on just about every milled surface. No biggie, just a pain. There were small casting \"nibs\" under the bed ways. This prevented getting a secure locking action on the banjo and tail stock. This also caused some roughness sliding these components. A bit of fine filing solved this. I'll probably never use the indexer. The screw that locks it is very loose in its threads. After a few hours of turning it turned screwed itself in until it started to engage. That woke me up. I wrapped a couple rounds of electrical tape to prevent it drifting. The speed dial is not perfectly linear. It will jump up a few more RPMs that desired. Takes a bit of fidgeting.\n\nYou think I hate this lathe, right? Nope! Love it! It runs VERY smoothly. The power is OUTSTANDING. Tail stock to head stock alignment is PERFECT. The price speaks for itself. You can't beat it.\n\nI would have had customer service on speed-dial had I not owned previous machines.

It would be very easy to drop one of these tiny pieces and I?m not sure you would recover it again.  The cutthroat trout turned out beautifully.  It looks fabulous in contrast to the pen barrel wood.  I made this pen for my son who learned how to fly fish during the pandemic (natural separation sport).  I gave it to him at Christmas.

In my research I found the PenPal Duplicator. At first I thought it was a fairly simple design and tried making one myself. It was a decent effort, but it just wasn't as solid and stable as it needed to be. So I decided to gamble and purchased one hoping to adapt it to a Grizzly 7x12 metal lathe. I removed the parts and attached them to a custom base only to find there was a problem with the height. I had to take a huge risk and slice off about 7/32\" off the bottom of the parts where they attached to the base (what kind of aluminum are those made of?). The risk paid off and it fits and works perfectly now.

Kit back then performed admirably, despite my shoddy workmanship at the time.  That pen finally ended up breaking a few months ago, so I ended up getting a new kit for Christmas.  Working with assembling the pen felt rather satisfying, and ended up pairing remarkably well with an alumilite and stabilized grapevine blank I had laying around.  The end result created a stunningly beautiful pen that looked as if it were on fire.  There is a good bit of weight to the product, comparable to the likes of a Steampunk or Dragon pen, I'd say.  Only thing that is a potential negative is the connection point within the pen, for where the 2 halves in construction meet, where a bad enough defect could prevent the pen from being assembled properly.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Riley","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/5ab07b8df35026c38a696e6d26fd5e22_1610729604117_0.jpeg"},{"id":39754,"product":"Dragon Antique Copper Rollerball Pen Kit","sku":"PKDRRAC","reviewTitle":"A fiery redemption.","reviewText":"I originally, 5 years ago, had made the Twist pen version of this kit, which had been... less than ideal, due to something inside preventing the refill from moving smoothly.

The copper finish ended up pairing rather well with the blanks I had chosen, which were a Pinot Red alumilite and Grapevine blank for the cap barrel, and one of Penn State Industries own Copper Kirinite blanks.

Shipping grease was not excessive, and cleaned up quickly with odor free mineral spirits. This is my first wood lathe, although I have a metal lathe, and I was glad I had lathe experience because to a total newbie, or anyone for that matter, the manual is useless! I had to search YouTube videos to figure out what the  long bolt with plastic knob, spring & nut was for! Other than that, assembly was straightforward. The alignment of the headstock and tailstock was spot on! I couldn\u2019t believe it! The supplied tool rack interferes with the tailstock lock if it\u2019s mounted where the exploded diagram shows it, but PSI has thoughtfully provided two more threaded holes behind the headstock to mount it there if desired. Runs incredibly quiet and smooth, and all the turning I did this afternoon was problem free!

I cut into the Cherry and found a grain structure that I thought would do the pen some justice.  I wasn't wrong due to the reaction the person responded with the moment she laid eyes on it.  She stated that it was the most beautiful pen she has ever seen and is absolutely sure that her attorney is going to love it also as he is a pen collector as well.  It turned out the as good as I could have hoped for but a little word of caution when turning Cherry, be very careful as it chips easily around the end corners of the blank.  I learned this the hard way when I was practicing on a piece before turning the pen blank.  \nThe picture I am submitting does Not do he pen any justice as the grain in this piece of Cherry isn't showing up the way I wanted it to.

This is not an easy pen to make, if you are new to pen making choose a different kit.  If you are going to make this pen, please buy the cap tool (PKRETOOL)  yes it's way over priced, but buy it anyway. it's so much easier when tuning the cap.  The clip notch is a pain, I have ruined a few top barrels figuring this out. Be careful not to cut any of the brass tube when squaring the cap/clip end.  Take care cutting the notch,  I use a thin blade (sharp) utility knife to cut mine, and 3X reader glasses to see it.  Because the cap barrel has one end that does not have a coupler, it looks unfinished if there is any glue in the tube or the end is ragged or not squared off well.  I use hardwood and plastic for this pen,  because softer woods don't finish well on the exposed cap end.  \nIf you are looking for an easy press and finish pen, keep looking. If you want to show off your skills and like a bit of a challenge then get 2 kits (you will likely ruin one the first time). I like the look, weight and quality of the pen kit, both the the roller ball and fountain pen kits.  5 stars for the kit and 5 stars for the challenge.","rating":5,"user":"Curtis","firstName":"CURTIS","url":null},{"id":38585,"product":"50 Pen Black Leather Carry Case","sku":"PKDISLB","reviewTitle":"Pen Case","reviewText":"I have a good variety of pens and this case holds them very well, except the Majestic.

For that application, this dust trap works extremely well.

When the dust trap is positioned properly, it collects about 85 to 90 percent of the wood chips and 100% of the sanding dust. If I were using something that generated more than the 100  or so cfm of my ShopVac, I would expect it to pick up more woodchips. \n\nRemoving the tool rest every time I need to sand and finish has taken a little getting used to. I don't see that as a fault in the design of the dust trap. I see it as adapting to a new piece of equipment. I do have another banjo from a similar sized lathe.

They condition the wood or acrylics to accept the finish of your choice to make a flawless end result you can brag about . I dampen a cloth with denatured alcohol and briefly run across the wood project after sanding and before using polishing papers for a clean surface . This allows the polishing papers to do the best job of fine tuning the wood grain to an almost brilliant shine even before you add the finish. After polishing papers , another quick swipe of the denatured alcohol cloth with the lathe running about 1000rpm , a few seconds to dry and your ready to apply the finish of your choice .

I started using the regular gouge first to knock the corners off the blank and rounding first for a two reasons . 1 , no sense in wearing out the carbide tip though it works great , I would rather keep it sharp as long as possible for the real cutting of the blank. \n2, when starting on a new blank with carbide the chip offs are larger and fly all over  the place . \nWhen turning acrylics the carbide tool can get very hot to the point of melting  or softening the blank so I rest it often to prevent this but OH the fine finish carbide gives .

It is pretty light (around 12-15 pounds) and is easy to move where ever you want to turn. Me I like looking at the lake. It has all the supplies needed to make slim line pens as seen in the photo of the set. I have to admit I like the carbide tools and use them as my primary tool, but, the included gouge does work well. \nI will say that there is a Slight learning curve on the lathe. It does not have the power of a full size lathe and I didn\u2019t expect it to either. You have to remember to use a fairly light touch when engaging the carbide tool with the wood. A heavy handed approach will stop the lathe from spinning for sure if you become aggressive. That being said, after you get use to the light touch approach the lathe spins the wood fast enough to do full Tool passes on pen blanks without any stoppage or hesitation.  I have yet to find a good base to set my lathe on that is comfortable, but, standing over the lathe does give you a better idea where wood need to be shaped a tad more.\nIf you are looking for a light weight lathe to so pens and/or spindles less than 7\u201d then this a the movable tool for you. One last thing. It is a great tool to teach new lathe turners with; it gives you the chance to give the light touch they might not learn if they are using a full power lathe. The new user can start off with good habits in turning materials on the lathe that they can use on bigger lathes. No regrets buying a less powerful tool as I knew from the start it was for small projects. But to be sure this lathe is for you be sure to read all the reviews. I think you will find that they give an accurate description of the light touch needed on the lathe and other pro\u2019s and cons.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Franklyn","url":null},{"id":37171,"product":"Bushing Buddy Organizer","sku":"PKBUBSYS","reviewTitle":"Great bushing storage","reviewText":"Great way to keep bushings organized","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Dennis","url":null},{"id":37170,"product":"Rhino Pen Blank 10 Piece Combo Pack","sku":"WXRB98","reviewTitle":"","reviewText":"I generally do not like to turn acrylic.

The end result is an eye-catching, well-balanced, comfortable-to-use pen.\n\nI agree with others that this pen isn't the best choice for beginners (it has a lot of parts and requires some precise drilling in the upper tube specifically).  The blank I used was 3/4\" square which you can just get away with on the upper barrel (9/16\" drill bit) if you make sure you have the bit centered; the lower barrel is 12.5 mm so 3/4\" fits easily.  You can use a 7/8\" square blank if you are uncomfortable with 3/4\".\n\nThe pen has some weight to it, which is nice, but it is overall well-balanced.  There is an indent around the writing tip area that makes for a comfortable grip, so it's nice for writing.\n\nAssembly went pretty easily.  From what I could tell, the only plastic part of the pen is the upper barrel thread that houses the large gold band.  It gave me no trouble, but you should take a little extra care when pressing it in (I had a wooden block beneath and a piece of packing foam on top to cushion the barrel from the press).  Make sure you read the assembly instructions/cautions before putting it together.  Also, pay attention to the orientation of the tubes as both are asymmetric by just a little (I left a bushing in one end of each tube until I had enough parts assembled to keep the ends correct).\n\nI'm very pleased with the result.  The Trustone really gives a great 'pop' to the pen, but just about any blank you like should go well with it.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Richard","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/123a92e7e20449c8036e1855d29b4c77_1593028583176_0.jpeg"},{"id":36919,"product":"3 Magnum Bolt Action Pen Kit Starter Set","sku":"PKCP7500SS","reviewTitle":"Heavy manly pen.","reviewText":"Easy assembly.

When I pressed the parts together, the barrels expanded an immeasurable amount but still it cracked the CA finish. It was ruined.

I tried it today and as said in many reviews you Can Not use a heavy hand when using your cutting tool or it will bog down on you.  But, I made a pen today with only one problem and it was my fault for not adjusting the tail stock tight enough.  I got the machine to take it on vacation at our lake house as it is out side of town and I needed something to do besides fish and watching deer. I anticipate teaching relatives how to make pens as this is a tad better than doing it on my Delta lather AND it will teach folks to Not have a heavy tool hand when turning a pen or spindle. I liked the speed dial position and you can hear the difference in the speed as you turn up the rpms. I heard a noise when I was turning a European pen and thought it was the lathe, but, it was the center bushing that moves and it was rattling.\nOver all this is a good lathe to learn on, great for demonstrations and just fun to use.

I'd also suggest you purchase at least 8 #6 washers to snug up the cap nuts. Do not be dismayed that the top and bottom gears do not tighten up to the cylinder. The play is necessary for turning the mirrors. My kit came with just enough gems.\nI needed to put an extra layer of tape on the mirrors to have them turn with the cylinder correctly.

I've only used my neighbors lathe (a Jet) a couple of times when I decided, this is a lot of fun. After doing a LOT of research, I decided this was the very best bang for the buck! Great, quiet lathe with room to expand. Great pen starter kits of which I haven't tried yet. I'm in the process of making my own carbide turning tools. The first handle TURNED out great, no pun intended. I absolutely love the variable speed control. It was one of the biggest selling points of this lathe for the price. If you're looking for a starter lathe with the ability to grow up to 42\", variable speed control, full 1hp. motor, this is the lathe for you! It is heavy enough that it doesn't move at all on the bench. It has rubber feet to rest on that isolates any vibration. I did buy the Nova chuck and a drill chuck, sold separately. You really do need these items to do some other types of turning. Also, YouTube is your best friend. I especially like \"Wortheffort\", I'm not sure if the guy is a school teacher, but his videos are like real lessons, not just Joe Blow showing you \"how too sorta, 'cause I like to be seen on TV\".

I had read previous reviews on people having difficulty in assembling their lathes. I was pleasantly surprised when the lathe was delivered completely assembled. The delivery driver, on the other hand, was not as pleased with that fact,\n\nI took it out of the box, connected the controls and I was off and running. The only minor glitch came when installing the spindle lock knob. The threads were messed up and it would thread into the headstock. A call to customer service the next day settled the problem and they sent a replacement out to me. I'm still giving this a 5 star rating. Things happen in manufacturing but I'm taking into account the actions taken. I got the replacement part and all is well.\n\nI haven't gotten to any bowls yet. Most of my turning has been pens, seam rippers, keychains, etc. for an upcoming craft fair.\n\nI like the variable speed capability of the lathe. Rather than picking a mid range speed like on my old lathe, I can use the optimal speed for whatever I'm doing. It has more power at 3/4 hp than my 1/2 hp previous lathe. I also like the two tool rests included in the package, That was a nice touch.\n\nThe only thing I wish is that the gooseneck on the light was a little more flexible. But even that is minor. The only thing I did besides plug it in and go was to have the tool rest ground. That's a personal preference and not a slight against the machine.\n\nI'm pleased with the purchase.

Perfect solution for Dust Collectors.","reviewText":"I had planned on converting my existing dust collector switch with a small wireless r/f remote like this uses, but somehow never got around to it. But I spotted a SlickDeals alert for the single-phase version of this starter on Amazon, and researched the 3-phase version to see if it would work for me instead. The box for the starter is very compact, so I was able to relocate it to a more convenient location next to the start switch for my main machine, and then use the included remote for another machine that uses the same dust collector. So far it has worked flawlessly but the remote is very cheaply made! Compared to the quality feel of the starter itself, the remote seems flimsy and has tiny on/off buttons. I would have liked to see a larger buttons comparable to those on the starter itself. That said, I would purchase this again because it has made turning the dust collector on and off so much more convenient than walking across the shop. And I find that I don't just let the collector run in between setups anymore because I didn't want to walk over and shut off the collector. Price/Quality Rating - 9, Ease of Install - 8, Convenience - 10. As is, this switch/remote combo is worth 4 1/2 stars.

This baby sucks close to 99% of it the dust with no mess to speak of.  My view is not hampered as it allows a lot of light through and I can easily see what I am turning. \n\nIt's  a great design as it mounts on the bango and moves with the tool rest.  \n\nI did install two more bolts on the bango mount and it now works perfect and stays put.  BTW the allen head bolts included with this dust trap are 5/16 NC thread but uses a metric allen wrench and the nuts are the same thread but takes a 10mm wrench!  \n\nI have tried other methods of collecting dust while working with pen blanks, including an 'expensive blue\" pen turning dust trap from another company with it's own mounting system on an upright rod that mounts to a bracket that secures to the bed of the lathe.  But it didn't work well for turning pens as a lot of chips went toward me and onto the bench and the floor.  And with it's optional clear shield it was 3 times the price of the new PSI dust trap. \n\nYou can't beat it, a great price and a tool that really works..

I purchased a gold pen and a gun metal pencil kit. I like that they have some heft to them. Mechanics function well. I didn't care for the pen refill that came with it so I purchased some Parker gel refills and now it writes as good as it looks. Some kits supply you with lower quality refills with their kits  (to save money) so do yourself a favor and upgrade your refill if the kit you buy uses a lower end refill. You can make somebody a beautiful pen but if it writes like a .50 cent Bic, your pen will not be enjoyed and seem cheap.\nThe pen kit was missing the spring, I emailed Penn State Ind. and they mailed me a replacement but it was the wrong spring. They never responded when I emailed them about the missing part. After about 2 weeks I received a shipping notice, it didn't say anything about what the shipment was and Penn State never contacted me about it, it just eventually showed up.\nThe second time I contacted them to let them know that they sent the wrong part, I sent them a link to the correct part on their website. I also asked them to please email me and keep me \"in the loop\", they never did. That took even longer. Same as before, I received a shipping confirmation with no other information. The part arrived and it was the correct part. \nFrom the time that I ordered the pen to the time that I received the correct part was about  6 weeks. I bought the pen and pencil set for a retirement gift but obviously I didn't get it finished in time because of the problems getting the correct part.\nThis is a nice kit and I will purchase more in the future.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Michael","url":null},{"id":34705,"product":"EEE-Ultra Shine Paste Wax: 250ml","sku":"PKSWEEE","reviewTitle":"","reviewText":"I was introduced to this product at a maker event last October and really like how little product it takes to do the job.

My mother loves to sew and while she makes many beautiful things, as she gets older it is harder for her to manipulate smaller seam rippers that are typically found in the stores. Browsing the kits just before the holidays I found this one and purchased several, making the first specifically for Mom. I made the grip longer and a bit wider but not so much that it became unwieldy. She loved it, even more then I had expected. To her sadness however a few weeks afterwards she dropped it and the small ends sharp point split off after it embedded in the wood floor. Here is where I really dig this kit. Because they're not stuck together using CA glue (at least I didn't), I was able to grab a spare end I bought and swap it out in seconds allowing Mom to go right back to work. Other kits would have required a complete new turning to repair the whole item.\n\nAfter posting pictures to my IG and FB pages to show off the work I had done, I had several people asking me I I had more to sell.

I was a bit apprehensive about the edges and texture around the grip area, but find it very comfortable and natural feeling. Still, I would love an option with the body of the pencil extending over that area. I left the clip off because I find them in the way when free hand drawing. Thankfully it didn't affect the fit. All materials seem to be of very high quality. I was not initially thrilled with the smoothness of the clutch mechanism, for it seemed to hang up the lead. After a little use the clutch seems to have worked out the kinks. Pencil has a nice weight to it, leaning toward heavy; which I prefer. The dark chrome is gorgeous. It has a wee little eraser under the plunger...I guess a nice option if you don't have a studio full of real erasers. Still, I suggest getting yourself a couple handheld erasers and forgo having to fuss with the cap for every little rogue mark.  Overall, a very comfortable, attractive pencil that has sidelined my German made workhorses. One of those, an $80 pinnacle of the industry, has an annoying \"creak\" where the brass body halves are joined by a plastic threaded coupler. In so many words or less, the answer was, \"Those have done that for 30+ years\". I assure you, this $10 pencil is far more solid than that! (Or $1300 pencil if you add the cost of lathe, tools, etc. needed to make the pencil, like my wife does.) I love mine, will be making more; but still holding my breath for one with more wood/acrylic coverage.","rating":5,"user":null,"firstName":"Rex","url":"https://wac.edgecastcdn.net/001A39/prod/media/TRXKvNvXO3C3p1usite/20ef1e34c593e068474c23272fe45e0e_1579069818365_0.jpeg"},{"id":34237,"product":"Workshop/Sketch Pencil Kit Chrome","sku":"PKSPCL","reviewTitle":"Great kit!","reviewText":"I use clutch pencils all the time, but this is the first one I've made.
